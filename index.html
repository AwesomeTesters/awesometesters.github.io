<h1> Awesome Testers You Should Keep Your Eye on Always </h1>
<p>
    In <a href="https://agiletestingdays.com/blog/125-awesome-testers-you-should-keep-your-eye-on-always/">2017</a>
    - <a href="https://agiletestingdays.com/blog/next-125-awesome-testers-you-should-keep-your-eye-on-always/">2018</a>,
    a working party within WiT community collected together two lists of
    awesome testers. A third list was created independently with focus on awesome testers of South America.
    This website draws on and continues that work. More awesome testers are discovered every day.
</p>
<p>
    Tester awesomeness is global, and we are just getting started on recognizing it. This
    list is a celebration of awesome testers that lead the way into the future of our
    industry and you should definitely keep your eye on!
</p>
<p>
    As always, lists are not comprehensive, but we put our best effort into making this list
    of the awesome people we look up to & learn from and expect that you can find nuggets of
    wisdom following their work. Welcome to Awesome Testers You Should Keep Your Eye on Always!
</p>
<p>
    <i>* Note: As lists always do, this represents the limited view of its authors. There are more
        amazing testers that either we forgot at time of making this list or have not yet had the
        pleasure of realizing they exist. The hard prioritization for a growing list has been made with
        the criteria of really brilliant, impactful people that first came to mind that deserve to
        be on this list of awesome testers.</i>

    and volunteers on helping new speakers get started with TechVoices.
